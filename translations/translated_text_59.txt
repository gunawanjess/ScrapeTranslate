Short understanding: Question 59 question 59 What has Christ promised this to us? Answer 59 In the establishment of the Holy Supper, which is described by Paul as follows: For I have received from the Lord, which I also surrendered that the Lord Jesus inThe night in which he was spending, took the bread;And if he had thanked it, he broke and said, takes, eat, that is my body that is broken for you;does that to my memory.In such a way he also took the drinking cup after eating the sacrament, and said: This drinking cup is the New Testament in my blood;Does that, as often as you will drink to my memory.Because as often as you will eat this bread and this drinking cup will drink, the death of the Lords proclaims until he comes.
